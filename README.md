# AI---ML---Learning

# AI Crash Course for a Full Stack Developer (3 Months)
This revised roadmap incorporates an introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside the foundational concepts of AI and Machine Learning (ML).
Month 1: Foundational Knowledge
	• Mathematics: Brush up on linear algebra, calculus, and probability & statistics. Khan Academy or 3Blue1Brown [YouTube channels] offer excellent resources.
	• Python Programming: If you're not familiar, learn Python using online courses from Coursera or edX.
	• Machine Learning Fundamentals: Grasp core ML concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation metrics. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera provides a great introduction.
	• Introduction to LLMs: Understand the concept of LLMs, their training process, and applications like question answering, text generation, and code translation. Explore introductory materials from Google AI or OpenAI.
Month 2: Deep Dive into AI Techniques
	• Deep Learning: Learn the basics of neural networks, CNNs, and RNNs. Online tutorials from TensorFlow or PyTorch can guide you through code implementation.
	• Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Master techniques for handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering using libraries like pandas in Python. Many online resources offer practical guides.
	• Hands-on Projects: Implement projects to solidify your understanding. Try a linear regression model or a KNN algorithm with the MNIST dataset.
Month 3: Specialization and Integration
	• Explore your area of interest: Think about how AI can complement your full-stack development skills (computer vision, NLP, recommendation systems).
	• Advanced Libraries and Frameworks: Delve deeper into relevant libraries like OpenCV, NLTK, or Scikit-learn depending on your chosen area.
	• Deployment and Cloud Integration: Learn how to deploy your AI models on cloud platforms like Google Cloud AI Platform or Amazon SageMaker.
	• Stay Updated: Follow AI blogs, researchers, and online communities to stay current with advancements.
Bonus Tips:
	• Practice consistently: Regularly work on projects and experiment with different algorithms.
	• Utilize online communities: Join forums like Stack Overflow or Reddit's r/MachineLearning for discussions and inspiration.
	• Contribute to Open Source Projects: Consider contributing to open-source AI projects on GitHub.
Remember:
	• Adjust the pace based on your learning style.
	• Focus on areas that require additional attention.
This revised roadmap equips you with a foundational understanding of LLMs within the broader context of AI and ML. With your strong coding background, you can leverage this knowledge to enhance your full-stack development skills and explore exciting possibilities with AI.
